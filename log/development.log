NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on.

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples."], ["link", "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.7.2333"], ["user_id", 1]]

This procedure produces a self-heating rate index, R70, calculated as the ratio of the time taken to reach 70°C (°C/h). The R70 index is a measure of the coals propensity to spontaneous combustion. R70 values for New Zealand coals are much higher than any previously published results. They show a rank dependence, whereby subbituminous coals have the highest propensity to spontaneous combustion (14.91–17.23°C/h). A lignite sample has an R70 value of 7.76°C/h, and high-volatile bituminous B coals have R70 values of 0.31–2.23°C/h. Samples stored for 2 years show the same rank trend. The nature of this trend is most likely a function of the internal surface area of the coal that governs the available sites for oxidation.

Depalmitoylation redistributes farnesylated Ras in all membranes, followed by repalmitoylation and trapping of Ras at the Golgi, from where it is redirected to the PM via the secretory pathway. This continuous cycle prevents Ras from nonspecific residence on endomembranes, thereby maintaining the specific intracellular compartmentalization. The de/reacylation cycle also initiates Ras activation at the Golgi by transport of PM-localized Ras guanosine triphosphate. Different de/repalmitoylation kinetics account for isoform-specific activation responses to growth factors."], ["link", "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166516200000343"], ["user_id", 5]]

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples."], ["link", "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.7.2333"], ["user_id", 1]]

This procedure produces a self-heating rate index, R70, calculated as the ratio of the time taken to reach 70°C (°C/h). The R70 index is a measure of the coals propensity to spontaneous combustion. R70 values for New Zealand coals are much higher than any previously published results. They show a rank dependence, whereby subbituminous coals have the highest propensity to spontaneous combustion (14.91–17.23°C/h). A lignite sample has an R70 value of 7.76°C/h, and high-volatile bituminous B coals have R70 values of 0.31–2.23°C/h. Samples stored for 2 years show the same rank trend. The nature of this trend is most likely a function of the internal surface area of the coal that governs the available sites for oxidation.

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples."], ["link", "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.7.2333"], ["user_id", 1]]

This procedure produces a self-heating rate index, R70, calculated as the ratio of the time taken to reach 70°C (°C/h). The R70 index is a measure of the coals propensity to spontaneous combustion. R70 values for New Zealand coals are much higher than any previously published results. They show a rank dependence, whereby subbituminous coals have the highest propensity to spontaneous combustion (14.91–17.23°C/h). A lignite sample has an R70 value of 7.76°C/h, and high-volatile bituminous B coals have R70 values of 0.31–2.23°C/h. Samples stored for 2 years show the same rank trend. The nature of this trend is most likely a function of the internal surface area of the coal that governs the available sites for oxidation.

Depalmitoylation redistributes farnesylated Ras in all membranes, followed by repalmitoylation and trapping of Ras at the Golgi, from where it is redirected to the PM via the secretory pathway. This continuous cycle prevents Ras from nonspecific residence on endomembranes, thereby maintaining the specific intracellular compartmentalization. The de/reacylation cycle also initiates Ras activation at the Golgi by transport of PM-localized Ras guanosine triphosphate. Different de/repalmitoylation kinetics account for isoform-specific activation responses to growth factors."], ["link", "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166516200000343"], ["user_id", 5]]

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples."], ["link", "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.7.2333"], ["user_id", 1]]

This procedure produces a self-heating rate index, R70, calculated as the ratio of the time taken to reach 70°C (°C/h). The R70 index is a measure of the coals propensity to spontaneous combustion. R70 values for New Zealand coals are much higher than any previously published results. They show a rank dependence, whereby subbituminous coals have the highest propensity to spontaneous combustion (14.91–17.23°C/h). A lignite sample has an R70 value of 7.76°C/h, and high-volatile bituminous B coals have R70 values of 0.31–2.23°C/h. Samples stored for 2 years show the same rank trend. The nature of this trend is most likely a function of the internal surface area of the coal that governs the available sites for oxidation.

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples."], ["link", "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.7.2333"], ["user_id", 1]]

This procedure produces a self-heating rate index, R70, calculated as the ratio of the time taken to reach 70°C (°C/h). The R70 index is a measure of the coals propensity to spontaneous combustion. R70 values for New Zealand coals are much higher than any previously published results. They show a rank dependence, whereby subbituminous coals have the highest propensity to spontaneous combustion (14.91–17.23°C/h). A lignite sample has an R70 value of 7.76°C/h, and high-volatile bituminous B coals have R70 values of 0.31–2.23°C/h. Samples stored for 2 years show the same rank trend. The nature of this trend is most likely a function of the internal surface area of the coal that governs the available sites for oxidation.

It is an intrinsic expansion whereby the scale of space itself changes. It means that the early universe did not expand \"into\" anything and does not require space to exist \"outside\" the universe - instead space itself changed, carrying the early universe with it as it grew. This is a completely different kind of expansion than expansions and explosions we see in daily life.

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples."], ["link", "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.7.2333"], ["user_id", 1]]

This procedure produces a self-heating rate index, R70, calculated as the ratio of the time taken to reach 70°C (°C/h). The R70 index is a measure of the coals propensity to spontaneous combustion. R70 values for New Zealand coals are much higher than any previously published results. They show a rank dependence, whereby subbituminous coals have the highest propensity to spontaneous combustion (14.91–17.23°C/h). A lignite sample has an R70 value of 7.76°C/h, and high-volatile bituminous B coals have R70 values of 0.31–2.23°C/h. Samples stored for 2 years show the same rank trend. The nature of this trend is most likely a function of the internal surface area of the coal that governs the available sites for oxidation.

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples."], ["link", "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.7.2333"], ["user_id", 1]]

This procedure produces a self-heating rate index, R70, calculated as the ratio of the time taken to reach 70°C (°C/h). The R70 index is a measure of the coals propensity to spontaneous combustion. R70 values for New Zealand coals are much higher than any previously published results. They show a rank dependence, whereby subbituminous coals have the highest propensity to spontaneous combustion (14.91–17.23°C/h). A lignite sample has an R70 value of 7.76°C/h, and high-volatile bituminous B coals have R70 values of 0.31–2.23°C/h. Samples stored for 2 years show the same rank trend. The nature of this trend is most likely a function of the internal surface area of the coal that governs the available sites for oxidation.

Depalmitoylation redistributes farnesylated Ras in all membranes, followed by repalmitoylation and trapping of Ras at the Golgi, from where it is redirected to the PM via the secretory pathway. This continuous cycle prevents Ras from nonspecific residence on endomembranes, thereby maintaining the specific intracellular compartmentalization. The de/reacylation cycle also initiates Ras activation at the Golgi by transport of PM-localized Ras guanosine triphosphate.

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples."], ["link", "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.7.2333"], ["user_id", 1]]

This procedure produces a self-heating rate index, R70, calculated as the ratio of the time taken to reach 70°C (°C/h). The R70 index is a measure of the coals propensity to spontaneous combustion. R70 values for New Zealand coals are much higher than any previously published results. They show a rank dependence, whereby subbituminous coals have the highest propensity to spontaneous combustion (14.91–17.23°C/h). A lignite sample has an R70 value of 7.76°C/h, and high-volatile bituminous B coals have R70 values of 0.31–2.23°C/h. Samples stored for 2 years show the same rank trend. The nature of this trend is most likely a function of the internal surface area of the coal that governs the available sites for oxidation.

We lack a theory of the functional properties of the human mind that could provide the needed integration—a theory about what the mechanisms of mind are \"designed\" to do. Evolutionary psychology provides the conceptual tools for emerging from this fragmented state. In this target article, I outline the fundamental premises of evolutionary psychology; illustrate the application of evolutionary psychology to domains such as reasoning, social exchange, language, aggression, jealousy, sex, and status; and then consider the implications of evolutionary psychology for the key branches of social, personality, developmental, and cognitive psychology and suggest ways in which these disciplinary boundaries can be transcended. I conclude by looking at the emergence of evolutionary psychology as our field matures into the 21st century.", "link"=>"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327965pli0601_1", "topic_ids"=>[""], "topics_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"name"=>"", "department_id"=>"2"}}}, "commit"=>"Submit", "id"=>"3"}

We lack a theory of the functional properties of the human mind that could provide the needed integration—a theory about what the mechanisms of mind are \"designed\" to do. Evolutionary psychology provides the conceptual tools for emerging from this fragmented state. In this target article, I outline the fundamental premises of evolutionary psychology; illustrate the application of evolutionary psychology to domains such as reasoning, social exchange, language, aggression, jealousy, sex, and status; and then consider the implications of evolutionary psychology for the key branches of social, personality, developmental, and cognitive psychology and suggest ways in which these disciplinary boundaries can be transcended. I conclude by looking at the emergence of evolutionary psychology as our field matures into the 21st century.", "link"=>"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327965pli0601_1", "topic_ids"=>["", "21"], "topics_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"name"=>"", "department_id"=>"2"}}}, "commit"=>"Submit", "id"=>"3"}

We lack a theory of the functional properties of the human mind that could provide the needed integration—a theory about what the mechanisms of mind are \"designed\" to do. Evolutionary psychology provides the conceptual tools for emerging from this fragmented state. In this target article, I outline the fundamental premises of evolutionary psychology; illustrate the application of evolutionary psychology to domains such as reasoning, social exchange, language, aggression, jealousy, sex, and status; and then consider the implications of evolutionary psychology for the key branches of social, personality, developmental, and cognitive psychology and suggest ways in which these disciplinary boundaries can be transcended. I conclude by looking at the emergence of evolutionary psychology as our field matures into the 21st century.", "link"=>"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327965pli0601_1", "topic_ids"=>["", "5", "21", "22", "23"], "topics_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"name"=>"Space Aliens", "department_id"=>"2"}}}, "commit"=>"Submit", "id"=>"3"}

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples."], ["link", "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.7.2333"], ["user_id", 1]]

This procedure produces a self-heating rate index, R70, calculated as the ratio of the time taken to reach 70°C (°C/h). The R70 index is a measure of the coals propensity to spontaneous combustion. R70 values for New Zealand coals are much higher than any previously published results. They show a rank dependence, whereby subbituminous coals have the highest propensity to spontaneous combustion (14.91–17.23°C/h). A lignite sample has an R70 value of 7.76°C/h, and high-volatile bituminous B coals have R70 values of 0.31–2.23°C/h. Samples stored for 2 years show the same rank trend. The nature of this trend is most likely a function of the internal surface area of the coal that governs the available sites for oxidation. Calculating the Suggate rank for any New Zealand coal can be used to rate its propensity to spontaneous combustion.

This continuous cycle prevents Ras from nonspecific residence on endomembranes, thereby maintaining the specific intracellular compartmentalization.

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples."], ["link", "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.7.2333"], ["user_id", 1]]

This procedure produces a self-heating rate index, R70, calculated as the ratio of the time taken to reach 70°C (°C/h). The R70 index is a measure of the coals propensity to spontaneous combustion. R70 values for New Zealand coals are much higher than any previously published results. They show a rank dependence, whereby subbituminous coals have the highest propensity to spontaneous combustion (14.91–17.23°C/h). A lignite sample has an R70 value of 7.76°C/h, and high-volatile bituminous B coals have R70 values of 0.31–2.23°C/h. Samples stored for 2 years show the same rank trend. The nature of this trend is most likely a function of the internal surface area of the coal that governs the available sites for oxidation.

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples."], ["link", "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.7.2333"], ["user_id", 1]]

This procedure produces a self-heating rate index, R70, calculated as the ratio of the time taken to reach 70°C (°C/h). The R70 index is a measure of the coals propensity to spontaneous combustion. R70 values for New Zealand coals are much higher than any previously published results. They show a rank dependence, whereby subbituminous coals have the highest propensity to spontaneous combustion (14.91–17.23°C/h). A lignite sample has an R70 value of 7.76°C/h, and high-volatile bituminous B coals have R70 values of 0.31–2.23°C/h. Samples stored for 2 years show the same rank trend. The nature of this trend is most likely a function of the internal surface area of the coal that governs the available sites for oxidation.

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples."], ["link", "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.7.2333"], ["user_id", 1]]

This procedure produces a self-heating rate index, R70, calculated as the ratio of the time taken to reach 70°C (°C/h). The R70 index is a measure of the coals propensity to spontaneous combustion. R70 values for New Zealand coals are much higher than any previously published results. They show a rank dependence, whereby subbituminous coals have the highest propensity to spontaneous combustion (14.91–17.23°C/h). A lignite sample has an R70 value of 7.76°C/h, and high-volatile bituminous B coals have R70 values of 0.31–2.23°C/h. Samples stored for 2 years show the same rank trend. The nature of this trend is most likely a function of the internal surface area of the coal that governs the available sites for oxidation.

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples."], ["link", "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.7.2333"], ["user_id", 1]]

This procedure produces a self-heating rate index, R70, calculated as the ratio of the time taken to reach 70°C (°C/h). The R70 index is a measure of the coals propensity to spontaneous combustion. R70 values for New Zealand coals are much higher than any previously published results. They show a rank dependence, whereby subbituminous coals have the highest propensity to spontaneous combustion (14.91–17.23°C/h). A lignite sample has an R70 value of 7.76°C/h, and high-volatile bituminous B coals have R70 values of 0.31–2.23°C/h. Samples stored for 2 years show the same rank trend. The nature of this trend is most likely a function of the internal surface area of the coal that governs the available sites for oxidation.

It is an intrinsic expansion whereby the scale of space itself changes. It means that the early universe did not expand \"into\" anything and does not require space to exist \"outside\" the universe - instead space itself changed, carrying the early universe with it as it grew. This is a completely different kind of expansion than expansions and explosions we see in daily life. It also seems to be a property of the entire universe as a whole rather than a phenomenon that applies just to one part of the universe or can be observed from \"outside\" it.", "link"=>"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/bf02345020", "topic_ids"=>["", "1"], "topics_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"name"=>"sserbrt", "department_id"=>"1"}}}, "commit"=>"Submit", "id"=>"1"}

It is an intrinsic expansion whereby the scale of space itself changes. It means that the early universe did not expand \"into\" anything and does not require space to exist \"outside\" the universe - instead space itself changed, carrying the early universe with it as it grew. This is a completely different kind of expansion than expansions and explosions we see in daily life. It also seems to be a property of the entire universe as a whole rather than a phenomenon that applies just to one part of the universe or can be observed from \"outside\" it.", "link"=>"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/bf02345020", "topic_ids"=>["", "1"], "topics_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"name"=>"Space", "department_id"=>"1"}}}, "commit"=>"Submit", "id"=>"1"}

It is an intrinsic expansion whereby the scale of space itself changes. It means that the early universe did not expand \"into\" anything and does not require space to exist \"outside\" the universe - instead space itself changed, carrying the early universe with it as it grew. This is a completely different kind of expansion than expansions and explosions we see in daily life. It also seems to be a property of the entire universe as a whole rather than a phenomenon that applies just to one part of the universe or can be observed from \"outside\" it.", "link"=>"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/bf02345020", "topic_ids"=>["", "1"], "topics_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"name"=>"Space", "department_id"=>"1"}}}, "commit"=>"Submit", "id"=>"1"}

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples."], ["link", "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.7.2333"], ["user_id", 1]]

This procedure produces a self-heating rate index, R70, calculated as the ratio of the time taken to reach 70°C (°C/h). The R70 index is a measure of the coals propensity to spontaneous combustion. R70 values for New Zealand coals are much higher than any previously published results. They show a rank dependence, whereby subbituminous coals have the highest propensity to spontaneous combustion (14.91–17.23°C/h). A lignite sample has an R70 value of 7.76°C/h, and high-volatile bituminous B coals have R70 values of 0.31–2.23°C/h. Samples stored for 2 years show the same rank trend. The nature of this trend is most likely a function of the internal surface area of the coal that governs the available sites for oxidation.

Depalmitoylation redistributes farnesylated Ras in all membranes, followed by repalmitoylation and trapping of Ras at the Golgi, from where it is redirected to the PM via the secretory pathway. This continuous cycle prevents Ras from nonspecific residence on endomembranes, thereby maintaining the specific intracellular compartmentalization. The de/reacylation cycle also initiates Ras activation at the Golgi by transport of PM-localized Ras guanosine triphosphate. Different de/repalmitoylation kinetics account for isoform-specific activation responses to growth factors."], ["link", "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166516200000343"], ["user_id", 5]]

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples."], ["link", "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.7.2333"], ["user_id", 1]]

This procedure produces a self-heating rate index, R70, calculated as the ratio of the time taken to reach 70°C (°C/h). The R70 index is a measure of the coals propensity to spontaneous combustion. R70 values for New Zealand coals are much higher than any previously published results. They show a rank dependence, whereby subbituminous coals have the highest propensity to spontaneous combustion (14.91–17.23°C/h). A lignite sample has an R70 value of 7.76°C/h, and high-volatile bituminous B coals have R70 values of 0.31–2.23°C/h. Samples stored for 2 years show the same rank trend. The nature of this trend is most likely a function of the internal surface area of the coal that governs the available sites for oxidation.

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples."], ["link", "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.7.2333"], ["user_id", 1]]

This procedure produces a self-heating rate index, R70, calculated as the ratio of the time taken to reach 70°C (°C/h). The R70 index is a measure of the coals propensity to spontaneous combustion. R70 values for New Zealand coals are much higher than any previously published results. They show a rank dependence, whereby subbituminous coals have the highest propensity to spontaneous combustion (14.91–17.23°C/h). A lignite sample has an R70 value of 7.76°C/h, and high-volatile bituminous B coals have R70 values of 0.31–2.23°C/h. Samples stored for 2 years show the same rank trend. The nature of this trend is most likely a function of the internal surface area of the coal that governs the available sites for oxidation.

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples."], ["link", "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.7.2333"], ["user_id", 1]]

In this target article, I outline the fundamental premises of evolutionary psychology; illustrate the application of evolutionary psychology to domains such as reasoning, social exchange, language, aggression, jealousy, sex, and status; and then consider the implications of evolutionary psychology for the key branches of social, personality, developmental, and cognitive psychology and suggest ways in which these disciplinary boundaries can be transcended.

We lack a theory of the functional properties of the human mind that could provide the needed integration—a theory about what the mechanisms of mind are \"designed\" to do. Evolutionary psychology provides the conceptual tools for emerging from this fragmented state. In this target article, I outline the fundamental premises of evolutionary psychology; illustrate the application of evolutionary psychology to domains such as reasoning, social exchange, language, aggression, jealousy, sex, and status; and then consider the implications of evolutionary psychology for the key branches of social, personality, developmental, and cognitive psychology and suggest ways in which these disciplinary boundaries can be transcended. I conclude by looking at the emergence of evolutionary psychology as our field matures into the 21st century."], ["link", "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301008298000379"], ["user_id", 2]]

This procedure produces a self-heating rate index, R70, calculated as the ratio of the time taken to reach 70°C (°C/h). The R70 index is a measure of the coals propensity to spontaneous combustion. R70 values for New Zealand coals are much higher than any previously published results. They show a rank dependence, whereby subbituminous coals have the highest propensity to spontaneous combustion (14.91–17.23°C/h). A lignite sample has an R70 value of 7.76°C/h, and high-volatile bituminous B coals have R70 values of 0.31–2.23°C/h. Samples stored for 2 years show the same rank trend. The nature of this trend is most likely a function of the internal surface area of the coal that governs the available sites for oxidation. Calculating the Suggate rank for any New Zealand coal can be used to rate its propensity to spontaneous combustion. Resin bodies in the subbituminous coal show no propensity to spontaneous combustion."], ["link", "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166516200000343"], ["user_id", 3]]

This continuous cycle prevents Ras from nonspecific residence on endomembranes, thereby maintaining the specific intracellular compartmentalization.

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples."], ["link", "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.7.2333"], ["user_id", 1]]

This procedure produces a self-heating rate index, R70, calculated as the ratio of the time taken to reach 70°C (°C/h). The R70 index is a measure of the coals propensity to spontaneous combustion. R70 values for New Zealand coals are much higher than any previously published results. They show a rank dependence, whereby subbituminous coals have the highest propensity to spontaneous combustion (14.91–17.23°C/h). A lignite sample has an R70 value of 7.76°C/h, and high-volatile bituminous B coals have R70 values of 0.31–2.23°C/h. Samples stored for 2 years show the same rank trend. The nature of this trend is most likely a function of the internal surface area of the coal that governs the available sites for oxidation.

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples."], ["link", "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.7.2333"], ["user_id", 1]]

In this target article, I outline the fundamental premises of evolutionary psychology; illustrate the application of evolutionary psychology to domains such as reasoning, social exchange, language, aggression, jealousy, sex, and status; and then consider the implications of evolutionary psychology for the key branches of social, personality, developmental, and cognitive psychology and suggest ways in which these disciplinary boundaries can be transcended.

We lack a theory of the functional properties of the human mind that could provide the needed integration—a theory about what the mechanisms of mind are \"designed\" to do. Evolutionary psychology provides the conceptual tools for emerging from this fragmented state. In this target article, I outline the fundamental premises of evolutionary psychology; illustrate the application of evolutionary psychology to domains such as reasoning, social exchange, language, aggression, jealousy, sex, and status; and then consider the implications of evolutionary psychology for the key branches of social, personality, developmental, and cognitive psychology and suggest ways in which these disciplinary boundaries can be transcended. I conclude by looking at the emergence of evolutionary psychology as our field matures into the 21st century."], ["link", "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301008298000379"], ["user_id", 2]]

This procedure produces a self-heating rate index, R70, calculated as the ratio of the time taken to reach 70°C (°C/h). The R70 index is a measure of the coals propensity to spontaneous combustion. R70 values for New Zealand coals are much higher than any previously published results. They show a rank dependence, whereby subbituminous coals have the highest propensity to spontaneous combustion (14.91–17.23°C/h). A lignite sample has an R70 value of 7.76°C/h, and high-volatile bituminous B coals have R70 values of 0.31–2.23°C/h. Samples stored for 2 years show the same rank trend. The nature of this trend is most likely a function of the internal surface area of the coal that governs the available sites for oxidation. Calculating the Suggate rank for any New Zealand coal can be used to rate its propensity to spontaneous combustion. Resin bodies in the subbituminous coal show no propensity to spontaneous combustion."], ["link", "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166516200000343"], ["user_id", 3]]

This continuous cycle prevents Ras from nonspecific residence on endomembranes, thereby maintaining the specific intracellular compartmentalization. The de/reacylation cycle also initiates Ras activation at the Golgi by transport of PM-localized Ras guanosine triphosphate.
